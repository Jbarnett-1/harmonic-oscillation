# Objective:
### Determine harmonic oscillator of psi outside the classic turning points in terms of x. 
### Find the probability of psi normalized from v=0 to v=5

#### classic-turning-points.mat
I identified the classical turning points and identified the x-positions to the energy as potential energy.

#### integration-outside-classic-turning-points.mat 
I converted those values in terms of y and found the values outside of the classical turning points.

#### determine-wavefunction.mat
I used this to determine the probability of a particle tunneling outside hte classical turning poists as the quantum numbers increase. 

***Through my findings, as quantum numbers increase and get bigger, the space between the probability outside the turning points get smaller. 
The energy is not being quantized and ultimately lead to the same answer. 
According to the Bohr Correspondence Principle, as quantum state increases, the quantum mechanics of it will collapse into classic mechanics.***
